    # OVERALL PROJECT ALGORITHM:
    # 1. load training and testing data into memory
    #
    # 2. build vocabulary using training data ONLY
    #
    # 3. instantiate an HMM with given number of states -- initial parameters can
    #    be random or uniform for transitions and inital state distributions,
    #    initial emission parameters could bea uniform OR based on vocabulary
    #    frequency (you'll have to count the words/characters as they occur in
    #    the training data.)
    #
    # 4. output initial loglikelihood on training data and on testing data
    #
    # 5+. use EM to train the HMM on the training data,
    #     output loglikelihood on train and test after each iteration
    #     if it converges early, stop the loop and print a message
